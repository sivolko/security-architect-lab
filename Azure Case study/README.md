### 1. Zero Trust Architecture - Interior Studio
**File**: [Zero-Trust-Architecture-Interior-Studio.md](./Zero-Trust-Architecture-Interior-Studio.md)

**Overview**: Complete enterprise Zero Trust security transformation for a global retail chain with 192 locations, implementing Microsoft Cybersecurity Reference Architecture (MCRA) principles.

**Key Components**:
- **Identity & Access Management**: Passwordless authentication using FIDO2, Windows Hello for Business, and Microsoft Authenticator
- **Device Security**: Hardware-backed attestation with Microsoft Intune and Defender for Endpoint
- **Network Security**: Microsegmentation with Azure Firewall Premium and Application Gateway WAF
- **Security Operations**: Microsoft Sentinel SIEM/SOAR with automated incident response
- **Compliance**: PCI DSS, GDPR, SOC 2 automation with continuous monitoring

**Architecture Highlights**:
- **Multi-factor Passwordless Authentication** eliminating 100% of password-based attacks
- **Device Health Attestation** using TPM 2.0 for hardware-backed security
- **Hub-and-Spoke Network Topology** with centralized security enforcement
- **Alternative ZTNA Approach** using Azure Private Link for application-centric security
- **12-Month Implementation Roadmap** with phased deployment strategy

**Technical Specifications**:
- Scale: 10,000 users, 5,000 devices, 275 retail locations (projected)
- Performance: <2s authentication, <100ms network latency, 99.9% availability
- Security: >95% threat detection accuracy, <15min MTTD, <4hr MTTR
- Cost: $2.7M 3-year TCO with detailed service breakdown

**Business Value**:
